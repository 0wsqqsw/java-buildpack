# Repository Builders

The repositories that are currently referenced by the buildpack are easily replicated.  Simple scripts are used to populate the repositories in an automated fashion.

| Component | Builder
| --------- | -------
| `openjdk` | <https://github.com/cloudfoundry/builder-openjdk>
| `tomcat` | <https://github.com/cloudfoundry/builder-tomcat>
